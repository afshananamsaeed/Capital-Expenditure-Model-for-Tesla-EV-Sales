# Capital-Expenditure-Model-for-Tesla-EV-Sales
This is a project I submitted to fulfill my requirements for the course- Financial Analysis for Value Creation and Decision Making at the University of Zurich.

Here, we collected Financial Data from the Website of "Tesla", which is a US based company that sells Electric Vehicles. 

We even collected other attributes about the company that we felt were important in improving the accuracy of our model like the Stock information and Production Capacity operation.

We tried to link climate change information to the sales of Tesla, and check whether they are correlated or not.

Three models were implemented in this project- one was to predict the sales demand for tesla, second for predicting the production capacity, and third to predict the required Capital Expenditures.

Our results have been mentioned in the Jupyter Notebook file and the User documentation.

The Visualizations for this project were conducted on Power BI, which can also be found in this repository.
